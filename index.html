    <p align="left"> Madel graduated from Saint Peter's University in 2019 with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science. Her undergraduate background is primarily in computational neuroscience, having given talks at MathFest 2017 and the Joint Mathematics Meeting 2018 regarding how to use a mathematical model to explain the role of patterned neural input on a rhythmic oscillatory network.
    <br>
    <br>
    Currently, Madel works full-time at Credit Suisse in the quant and technology space as a value at risk modeler covering securitized products.
    <br>
    <br>
    Madel is also pursuing ongoing studies part-time at the Rutgers Full Stack Development Coding Bootcamp with aspirations of one day becoming a full stack developer.

        "Emerson once said that 'life is a journey, not a destination.' I apply the same ideology to learning. I do not believe there is any point in our lives where we can say that we have learned all there is to know about any particular topic or field.
        The beauty of learning is in its nonexistant limits &mdash; with access to the right material, anyone can learn anything and no one is ever too young or too old to start that journey."
    <br>
    <br>
    In her free time, Madel enjoys eating all kinds of food, taking spontaneous naps, and cycling.
